# Troubleshooting

This page helps diagnose Bluetooth adapter issues on uConsole and Raspberry Pi OS.

Primary support target:
- uConsole + AIO v2

Secondary support target:
- Other Linux devices on a best-effort basis

## One-command diagnosis

Run the automated report script:

```bash
cd uconsole-ble-foxhunt-toolkit
chmod +x scripts/troubleshoot-bluetooth.sh
./scripts/troubleshoot-bluetooth.sh
```

The script writes a timestamped report in `logs/` that includes:
- controller inventory
- HCI details
- rfkill state
- USB devices
- kernel module status
- Bluetooth-related kernel log snippets
- quick recommendations

## One-command safe recovery + before/after report

If `hci1` is flaky (for example local-name read errors), run:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/recover-hci.sh
```

Or target a specific interface:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/recover-hci.sh hci1
```

What it does:
- runs `troubleshoot-bluetooth.sh` before changes
- applies safe reset steps (`rfkill`, `hciconfig`, `btmgmt`, bluetooth service restart)
- runs diagnostics again after changes
- writes a recovery summary in `logs/recover-*.txt`

## Common findings and fixes

### 1) Only one HCI controller appears

Symptom:
- `bluetoothctl list` shows only one controller

Cause:
- many AC1200 adapters are Wi-Fi only and do not expose Bluetooth

Fix:
- run in single-adapter mode by setting both `CAPTURE_HCI` and `HUNT_HCI` to the same interface in `config/interfaces.conf`
- or run `./scripts/set-adapter-mode.sh single`

### 2) hci1 local-name read error

Symptom:
- `hciconfig -a` shows local-name read failure or timeout on `hci1`

Recovery steps:

```bash
sudo rfkill unblock all
sudo hciconfig hci1 down || true
sudo hciconfig hci1 reset || true
sudo hciconfig hci1 up
sudo btmgmt -i hci1 power off
sudo btmgmt -i hci1 power on
sudo btmgmt -i hci1 le on
sudo btmgmt -i hci1 bredr off
```

If scan traffic still appears in `btmon -i hci1`, the adapter is often usable for passive monitoring.

Note:
- `Set BR/EDR ... failed with status 0x0b (rejected)` is commonly benign on LE-only or restricted adapters.
- In that case, continue with BLE scanning/monitoring; BR/EDR disable is not required for passive BLE workflows.

### 3) btmon package confusion

Symptom:
- package manager cannot find `btmon`

Fix:
- install `bluez` (btmon is part of bluez, not a standalone package)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y bluez bluez-tools
```

### 4) Adapter blocked by rfkill

Symptom:
- `rfkill list` reports soft or hard block

Fix:

```bash
sudo rfkill unblock all
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
```

### 5) Driver/firmware issues in dmesg

Symptom:
- `dmesg` shows btusb/btmtk firmware load failures or timeouts

Fix:
- replug USB adapter
- use powered hub if power is marginal
- restart Bluetooth service
- test with a known-good BLE dongle if instability persists

## MediaTek AC1200 specific diagnostics

### About the AC1200 (HackerGadgets)

The **AC1200 USB-C Wi-Fi card** is sourced from [HackerGadgets.com](https://www.hackergadgets.com/) and is a powerful upgrade for uConsole + AIO v2 deployments:

**Key Specifications:**
- **Chipset:** MediaTek MT7921AUN (WiFi 6/6E + Bluetooth 5.2 combo)
- **WiFi:** Passive monitor mode support + active connectivity (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax)
- **Bluetooth 5.2:** Passive scanning (no transmission required for this toolkit)
- **Antennas:** 2× IPEX U.FL connectors each for WiFi and Bluetooth (swappable high-gain options)
- **Interface:** USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C

**For this toolkit:** The AC1200 is **fully passive-capable** for BLE monitoring. It scans and listens without transmitting.

### Diagnostics

If you are using the AC1200 USB-C Wi-Fi card, run:

```bash
./scripts/diagnose-mediatek-ac1200.sh
```

This collects USB inventory, controller visibility, rfkill state, module load info, and relevant Bluetooth/MediaTek dmesg lines into a log file under `logs/`.

## Signature scan for common scripted spam

Run against any btmon capture:

```bash
python3 scripts/ble-signature-scan.py --input logs/btmon-hci0-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log
```

Captures also produce a `.btsnoop` trace alongside the text log. It is much
smaller and can be replayed or summarized directly, which makes it the better
file to attach when reporting an issue or sharing evidence with venue staff:

```bash
btmon -r logs/btmon-hci0-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.btsnoop
btmon -a logs/btmon-hci0-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.btsnoop
```

### Opening captures in Wireshark

`.btsnoop` is a native Wireshark capture format, so no conversion is needed.
Open the file directly with `File > Open`, or from the command line:

```bash
wireshark logs/btmon-hci0-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.btsnoop
tshark -r logs/btmon-hci0-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.btsnoop
```

Useful display filters once the capture is loaded:

```
bthci_evt.code == 0x3e                  # all LE Meta events
bthci_evt.le_meta_subevent == 0x0d      # LE Extended Advertising Report
bthci_evt.le_meta_subevent == 0x02      # LE Advertising Report (legacy)
btcommon.eir_ad.entry.company_id        # advertisements carrying vendor data
```

Note the subevent value. Modern BT 5.x controllers report advertisements as
**Extended** Advertising Reports (`0x0d`); filtering only on the legacy `0x02`
returns nothing on those adapters, which looks like an empty capture.

Extract fields for scripting:

```bash
tshark -r <file> -T fields -e bthci_evt.bd_addr | sort -u          # advertisers
tshark -r <file> -T fields -e btcommon.eir_ad.entry.device_name    # names
```

`editcap` can convert to other formats if a tool needs pcapng.

Wireshark can also capture live: `tshark -D` lists a `bluetooth-monitor`
interface that mirrors what `btmon` sees. The toolkit writes `.btsnoop` itself
so captures stay reproducible and attachable, but the live interface is useful
for interactive work.

### Why scanning uses bluetoothctl, not `btmgmt find`

The controller only emits LE Advertising Report events while a scan is active,
so `btmon` alone records nothing on an idle adapter.

`btmgmt find -l` works when run interactively but **silently does nothing when
backgrounded**: it is a `bt_shell` program, and detached from a controlling
terminal it blocks in its event loop without ever issuing Start Discovery. The
process stays alive and returns success, so the failure is invisible except
that captures come back empty. `--timeout` does not fix this; the process hangs
instead of exiting.

Scanning is therefore driven by `bluetoothctl`, fed commands over a FIFO whose
write end the script holds open. Closing that write end sends EOF, which makes
`bluetoothctl` quit and stops discovery, so the FIFO must stay open for the
whole capture. The script also issues `select <address>` first, which pins the
scan to the intended radio on dual-adapter rigs instead of whichever controller
is currently the default.

If a capture is empty, verify a scan is actually running:

```bash
btmgmt -i hci0 info | grep 'current settings'   # must include 'powered'
bluetoothctl show | grep Discovering            # should say 'yes' during capture
```

This scanner is defensive and heuristic-based. It reports likely pattern families (for example Flipper-like, Marauder-like, Fast Pair lure flood, generic burst) with confidence and evidence, but it cannot prove attribution to a specific tool.

### Signature tuning

Copy and tune profile values for your RF environment:

```bash
cp config/signatures.conf.example config/signatures.conf
nano config/signatures.conf
```

You can switch profile directly per run:

```bash
python3 scripts/ble-signature-scan.py --input logs/btmon-hci0-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log --profile aggressive
```

## Validation and regression checks

Before heading to the field, run:

```bash
./tests/test-toolkit.sh
```

This exercise checks the toolkit scripts, the expected config files, and writes a validation report into `logs/`.

## Optional GPS merge for later plotting

If you want to start correlating BLE observations with GPS positions, use:

```bash
python3 scripts/ble-gps-merge.py --gps /path/to/gps.csv --ble /path/to/ble.csv --output logs/ble-gps-plot.csv
```

GPS is optional. If GPS is missing, stale, or unreliable, you can omit `--gps` and the script will still write the BLE rows with blank latitude/longitude fields for later plotting when a GPS source becomes available.

## Shareable debug bundle

You can send this output when asking for help:

```bash
latest=$(ls -1t logs/troubleshoot-*.txt | head -n 1)
echo "$latest"
sed -n '1,220p' "$latest"
```
