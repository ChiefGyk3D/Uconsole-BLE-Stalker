# Walk-in RSSI tracker.
#
# Tracks one or more target addresses and reports a rolling median RSSI, which
# is what you actually walk in on. Instantaneous RSSI is far too noisy to
# navigate by, especially indoors where multipath swings readings by 20 dB.
#
# Multiple targets matter because most devices rotate their address. Resolve a
# target to its current address set with ble-fingerprint.py, then track them
# all at once:
#
#   sudo ./scripts/foxhunt-rssi.sh --hunt "WHOOP" --from-capture logs/cap.log
#
# Read the tier warning that ble-fingerprint.py prints. If the target resolved
# at 'model' or 'ambiguous' tier, the address set may span several different
# devices and the RSSI trend will jump between them.
