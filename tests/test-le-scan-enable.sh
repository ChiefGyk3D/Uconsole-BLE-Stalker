# Regression test for LE scan enablement.
#
# The original scanner shelled out to a backgrounded 'btmgmt find'. btmgmt is a
# bt_shell program: detached from a controlling terminal it blocks in epoll and
# never issues Start Discovery, while still reporting success. Every capture
# therefore recorded nothing, and no test noticed because the capture tests stub
# btmon and never invoke the scanner at all.
#
# This test stubs bluetoothctl and btmgmt and asserts the scan control commands
# are actually delivered, and that teardown leaves nothing behind.
